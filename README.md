# [Nexmo](https://nexmo.com) Demo Application #

Just for fun this application is used for proxying text messages to someone so that you can hide your real phone number from the recipient.

To use the app, just paste in your api key and secret, click to load phone numbers from your account in order to
choose which one you want to send from, then enter the phone number to send a text to, a message, and your done :-)
